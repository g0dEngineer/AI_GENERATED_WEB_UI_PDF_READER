# My Ai generated "TalkToYourPDF" ui mockup,  can load pdfs too



Unfortunately, OpenAi endpoint has been officially discontinued, so the ui now only allows pdf loading and displays said pdf text once browse/selected and asked is clicked.

# Time taken to prepare prompt: about 15 minutes. (Spent troubleshooting and refining prompt, i.e. asking Gpt to add components after initial prompt or correct bugs, taking gpt code as inputs in sequence)

# Prompt:

Make simple html with metroui css styling with flat black buttons and flat text fields:

1. To accept pdf upload, load pdf bytes to variable of formatted text (upload ui center of screen)
2. Call any free chatbot api and pass text from (1) to chatbot
3. Allow text input to ask questions about pdf  (text ui center of screen)
